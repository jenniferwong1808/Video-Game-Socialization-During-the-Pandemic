# Video-Game-Socialization-During-the-Pandemic

This project looks at several sources of online socialization, such as games and streaming, and analyzes the change in consumption of these mediums over the course of the COVID pandemic. It primarily looks at the explicit number of people and the general growth in each segment, but selectively also focuses on the change in the growth as well, to see not only if the growth increased, but also to see if the rate of growth increased as well.

### We are trying to answer the question: 

Did the video game industry and community experience an increase in online socialization and interaction among players during the COVID-19 pandemic?
